# 1. Conceptual Framework | Standard‐Setting | Financial Reporting

> *25%–35%*

+ SFAC = (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Concepts

## 1.1 Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting

The conceptual framwork is set forth in seven statements identified as SFACs and serves as a **basis** for all FASB pronouncements.

### 1.1.1 SFAC No. 8, *Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting*

#### 1.1.1.1 Objectives

The objective of general financial reporting is to provide **financial information** useful to **primary users** in making econominc decisions.

**Priamry Users**:

+ External

+ Existing and potential investors, lenders, and otehr creditors

**Financial Information**:

+ To meet the informational needs

+ Resources of the entity, claims against the entity and changes in the resources and claims 
+ Reflected by accrual accounting and past cash flow

#### 1.1.1.2 Qualitative Characteristics and Enhancements

The fundamental qualitative characteristics of accounting information are relevance and faithful representation.

**Relevant**:

+ Capable of making a difference in the decisions made by users
+ Values that are predictable , confirmatory and material

> *There is no specified a uniform quantitative threhold for materiality.*

**Faithful** :

+ Reliable
+ Complete, neutral (free from bias), free from error

> *With reasonable accuracy.*

Enhancing Qualitative Characteristic are comparability, verifiability, timliness, and understandability.

+ Consistent with trend analysis
+ Independent observers can reach consensus 
+ Availiable in time
+ Clear and concise

#### 1.1.1.3 The Cost Constraint

Pervasive constraint

Benefit > Cost ?

### 1.1.2 SFAC No.3, *Elements of the Financial Statements*

Specified in SFAC 6

![Screenshot 2021-11-24 at 14.32.01](../Documents/FRA_Typora Study Notes/assets/Screenshot 2021-11-24 at 14.32.01.png)

### 1.1.3 SFAC No.4, *Objectives of Financial Reporting by Nonbusiness Entities*

All **governments** and all **not‐for‐profit organizations**, except those associated with businesses.

+ Resources come from contributions and grants
+ Operating purposes are other than to provide goods or services for profits
+ Lack of ownership

The **objective** is to provide information useful in 

+ Making resources allocation decisions
+ Assessing services
+ Assessing management stewardship and performance

**Users**:

+ Resource providers, constituents, governing and oversight bodies, and managers

### 1.1.4 Financial Accounting Standards

#### 1.1.4.1 Standard‐Setting Bodies

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has the legal authority to establish U.S. GAAP. **However**, the SEC has allowed the accounting profession to establish GAAP **and** self-regulate.

+ **CAP**. Determined Gaap from 1939 until 1959
+ **APB**. Determined GAAP from 1959 to 1973
+ **FASB**. Established in 1973, the Financial Accounting Standards Board is an independent full-time organisation that has determined GAAP since then.

#### 1.1.4.2 FASB *Accounting Standards Codification*

Effective july1, 2009, the FASB *Accounting Standards Codification* became the single source of authoritative nongovernmental US GAAP. Accounting and financial reporting practives **not** included in the codification are **not** GAAP.

#### 1.1.4.3 Private Company Council (PCC)

To establish alternatives to US GAAP, where appropriate, to make private company financial statements more relecant, less complex, and cost-beneficial.

#### 1.1.4.4 FASB *Accounting Standards Updates*

Ongoing Standard-Setting Process

To updates the *Accounting Standards Codification* for new US GAAP issed by the FASB **and** for amendaments to the SEC content

*Accounting Standards Updates* are **not** authoritative literature, but instead provide background information, supplementary information regarding updates and changes in the codifications. 

> *Tips: 所有新的规则和修正案都已经写入GAAP中，Updates只对变更的相关说明。*

### 1.1.5 SFAC No. 5, *Recognition and Measurement*

**Five Financial Statements**

- Financial position at the end of the period
- Earnings for the period
- Comprehensive income for the period
- Cash flows during the period
- Investments by and distributions to owners during the period

**Recognition Criteria**

- Measureability
- Relevance
- Reliability

**Measurement Attributes**

- Historical cost. PP&E
- Current cost. Inventory
- Net realizable value. AR
- Current market value. Market securities - TS & AFS
- Present value of future cash flows. Bonds, notes

> *Financial statements use a mixed attribute system that **allows** assets and liabilities to be measured at various bases.*

**Underlying Assumptions** 

+ Entity
+ Going concern
+ Monetary unit
+ Periodicity
+ Accrual accounting
+ Full disclosure principle

### 1.1.6 SFAC No. 6, *Elements of the Financial Statements*

Assets | Liabilities | Equity (Net Asset)

+ BS
+ A-L=E

Investments by Owners | Distributions to Owners

+ Transfer of cash, property or services from/to owners 
+ Not on IS, excluded from CI

Comprehensive Income 

+ NI+OCI

Revenues|Expenses

+  Part of normal operations

Gains|Losses

+ Nonoperating 
+ NRV=SP-Costs to sell

### 1.1.7 SFAC No. 7, *Using Cash Flow Information and Present Value in Accounting Measurements*

> SFAC No. 7 applies only to measurement issues that are determined using future cash flows only. 

从五个方面考虑未来现金流折现:

+ Estimate of future cash flow
+ Timing variations
+ Time value of money (the risk-free interest rate)
+ Credit risk
+ Liqudity risk and other factors

#### 1.1.7.1 Present Value Computations

**Traditional Approach**

+ PV bonds

**Expected Cash Flow Approach**

+ PV warranties
+ Risk and Uncertainty adjustments

## 1.2 General‐Purpose Financial Statements: For‐Profit Business Entities

### 1.2.1 Balance Sheet

#### 1.2.1.1 Identifiable assets

**Current assets**:

界定 Current assets 和 Non-current assets 是看在 max{1 年，一个营运周期}中，能否变现。

- Cash and cash equivalents 现金和现金等价物
- Account receivable 应收账款
    - contra account 备抵帐户，是坏账准备
- inventory 存货，包括原料、半成品 、 产成品
- Short-term marketable securities 短期可以在市场上卖掉的资产

**Non-current asset**:

非流动资产还分为 Tangible assets 有形资产和 Intangible assets 无形资产。

- Property, plant and equipment（PP&E）固定资产
- Intangible assets 无形资产，包括：patents专利权、专有技术 、copyright 版权 、trademarks 商标权。在中国特有的无形资产——土地使用权，而在很多国家，企业和个人是可以拥有土地所有权的，这种情况下土地就是固定资产而不是无形资产。
- Long-term investment 长期投资，不准备在一年或一个经营周期内变现的投资
- Deferred tax assets 递延所得税资产

#### 1.2.1.2 Non-identifiable assets

goodwill 商誉，指溢价收购的溢价部分，和企业的信誉没有任何关系。

#### 1.2.1.3 Liability

- Accounts payable 应付账款
- Unearned revenue 预收账款
- Accrued expense 应计费用，费用已经记录，但是钱还没支付
- Tax payable 应交税款
- Long-term debt 长期负债
- Defferred tax liabilities 递延所得税负债

#### 1.2.1.4 Owners’s Equity

> Also known as net asset or "residual" interest

**Contribution**:

- **Capital 股本**（资本市场惯例是 1 元 1 股，股本就是：1元/股*股数）
- **Additional paid-in-capital 资本公积**，是发行金额超出总股本的溢价部分。例如：10转10，转股就是把资金公积的一部分挪到了股本中。
- Treasury stock 库存股（备抵科目，负数列置，没有投票权，没有分红，库存股不能列为公司资产，而是以负数形式列为一项股东权益。）

**Internally generated**:

- **Retained Earnings 留存收益（RE）**，利润表中的 NI 扣减掉分配的 Dividend 就得到 RE，RE 是在 IFRS 和 GAAP 下才有的。中国的会计准则没有留存收益，而是分成**“利润-未分配利润”**和**“盈余公积”**两项。
- Accumulated other comprehensive income 累积其他综合收益（AOCI）
- Minority interest 少数股东权益

资产负债表可以用于评判一个公司的 liquidity（短期偿债能力） 和 solvency（长期偿债能力）。评判 liquidity，就看流动资产（Current Assets）和流动负债（Current Liability）。评判 solvency，就看总负债（Liability）和所有者权益（Owner’s Equity）。

### 1.2.2 Income Statement and Terminology

The IS is useful in determining profitability, value, and creditworthiness.

#### 1.2.2.1 Costs and Unexpired Costs

**Cost**:

+ An amount, measured in money, expended for items
+ Expensed immediately - "period"

**Unexpired costs**:

+ Allocated in a matched manner and charged against revenues from future periods
+ Capitalization as asset

> 典型账户包括
>
> 1. *Inventory (COGS)*
> 2. *Prepaid/Unexpired cost of insurance (Insurance expense)*
> 3. NBV of fixed assets (Depreciation expense)
> 4. *Unexpired cost of patents (Amortization expense)*

#### 1.2.2.2 *Reporting Revenue Gross vs. Net*

净收入是指公司或个人从总收入中<u>扣除</u>税款和其他扣除后的收入。 净收入直接依赖于总收入，而总收入不依赖于净收入。

> See 2.10.1.5

**Gross Concept**

From <u>ordinary</u> selling and purchasing <u>core</u> inventory and other services

+ **Revenues**. Sales
+ **Expenses**. COGS, SG&A

- COGS （Cost of Good Sold）销货成本或者营业成本（包含了设备的折旧费）
- Gross Profit 毛利润（收入减去销货成本）
- SG&A 营销费用和管理费用的总和（包含了打印机等的折旧费。中国是把营销费用和管理费用拆开的）
- Operating Expense 销货成本+营销费用+管理费用
- EBIT 息税前收益 （先扣利息，后扣税。利息的税盾作用）
- EBT 税基（这里扣掉的利息费用对应中国会计准则中的财务费用）

### 1.2.3 Statement of Comprehensive Income

可供出售金融资产增值，不进入利润表，而是带来《综合收益表》中的其他综合收益（OCI）增加。进而影响到《资产负债表》中的所有者权益中的累积综合收益（AOCI）增加。

- 货币汇兑的利得/损失
- 最低养老金负债调整（DB plan）

#### 2.10.1.1 Identify the Contract

##### 2.10.1.1.1 Collectibility Threshold

一个实体只有在以下两种情况下才将其收到的任何对价确认为收入：

1. 实体没有剩余的义务向客户转让商品或服务，并且实体已经收到了几乎所有的对价，并且是不可退还的，**或**
2. 协议已经终止，并且对价是不可退还的。

一个实体应将从客户处收到的任何对价确认为负债，直到满足上述所有标准。

**Example 1**

![Screenshot 2021-11-25 at 16.50.38](../Documents/FRA_Typora Study Notes/assets/Screenshot 2021-11-25 at 16.50.38.png)

##### 2.10.1.1.2 Combination of Contract

Prerequisitions for the combination

- 合同是作为一揽子计划谈判的，具有单一的商业目标。
- 一个合同中支付的对价金额取决于其他合同的价格或业绩。
- 一份合同中支付的对价取决于另一份合同的价格或业绩。
- 合同中承诺的商品或服务（或每个合同中承诺的部分商品或服务）是一项单一的履约义务。

In this case, one can applies revenue recognition guidance to the portfolio rather than to the individual contracts within that portfolio.

#### 2.10.1.2 Identify the Performance Obligations in the Contract

**Control** is defined as the ability to:

- direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from an asset
- prevent other entities from directing the use of and obtaining the benefits from an asset (“defensive control”)

**Not Separately identifiable** 

- The entity provides a significant service of integrating the good or service into a bundle of goods or services that represent the combined output contracted for by the customer 
- Highly interrelated or interdependent

##### 2.10.1.2.1 Separate dentifiable performance obligations

A good or service is *distinct* if it is both of the following:

- **Capable of being distinct:** The good or service can be used on its own or in combination with other goods or services that could be obtained elsewhere by the customer
- **Separately identifiable**: The seller is providing individual goods or services as opposed to providing a combined good or service in which the individual goods or services function as an input

**Example 2**

![Screenshot 2021-11-25 at 19.48.39](../Documents/FRA_Typora Study Notes/assets/Screenshot 2021-11-25 at 19.48.39.png)

##### 2.10.1.2.2 Single performance obligation

**Not Separately identifiable** 

- No revenue as each is done
- Must wati until last item

If the good or service is *not*  separately identifiable, then combine the good or service with other goods or services until a distinct bundle is formed.

**Example 2**

![Screenshot 2021-11-25 at 19.53.50](../Documents/FRA_Typora Study Notes/assets/Screenshot 2021-11-25 at 19.53.50.png)

**Example 3:** Design and built

#### 2.10.1.3 Determine the Transaction Price

##### 2.10.1.3.1 Variable Consideration

The amount of variable consideration should be estimated by using either of the following methods:

- **Expected value method:** The sum of probability‐weighted amounts in a range of possible consideration amounts. This method is appropriate when an entity has a large number of contracts with similar characteristics.
    - discounts, rebates, refunds, credits, price concessions, incentives, performance bonuses, penalties (see Example 4)
- **Most likely amount method:** The single most likely amount in a range of possible consideration amounts; the single most likely outcome of the contract. This method is appropriate when the contract has only two possible outcomes: an entity either achieves a performance bonus or does not.

**Example 4:**

![Screenshot 2021-11-26 at 00.05.49](../Documents/FRA_Typora Study Notes/assets/Screenshot 2021-11-26 at 00.05.49.png)

##### 2.10.1.3.2 Signifiant Financing

##### 2.10.1.3.3 Noncash Consideration

如果<u>客户提供</u>货物或服务（例如，材料或劳动力）以促进合同的履行，并且实体获得对这些提供的货物或服务的控制权，那么这些提供的货物或服务必须作为非现金对价入账，按<u>settlement day的公允价值</u>计量。

##### 2.10.1.3.4 Consideration Payable to a Customer

一个实体以现金、信贷或其他项目的形式<u>支付给客户</u>的金额，然后客户可以用它来<u>抵偿欠该实体</u>的金额。

应付给客户的对价通常作为交易价格（即revenue）的减少入账。

#### 2.10.1.4 Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract

proportional basis (Fair Market Value)

##### 2.10.1.4.1 standalone selling price

**Example 5** 

卖方收到一份IT设备的订单；客户同意在交货后45天付款。该订单还包括两年的IT设备维护，从交货的当月开始。该订单总额为10,000美元。IT设备的单独售价为9120美元，两年的维护协议的单独售价为2880美元。

Step 1: 总的独立销售价格是12,000美元（9,120美元+2,880美元）。设备占价格的76%（9,120美元÷12,000美元），维护协议是剩余的24%（2,880美元÷12,000美元）。

Step2: 这些百分比被用来将10,000美元的交易价格分配给两个不同的履约义务：7,600美元给设备，2,400美元给维护协议。

##### 2.10.1.4.2 Allocating a discount

判断条件：

<center>∑ 合同中各部分的独立销售价格 > 成交价 



如果折扣针对整体交易，则按权重分配给所有各部分义务：

<center>Discount~a~/Total Discount = Allocated Transaction Price~a~/Total Transaction Price</center>

##### 2.10.1.4.3 Transaction Price Changes

#### 2.10.1.5 Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation

Performance obligations may be satisfied either over time or at a point in time.

##### 2.10.1.5.1 Satisfied at a point in time

以下情况产生的收入在交易日一次性确认: 

- The remainder of the purchase price is due on <u>completion</u> of the unit
- If the customer defaults on the contract before completion, the entity only has the right to retain the deposit

> Tips: 货物交割权力转移，收回款项可以确定

##### 2.10.1.5.2 Satisfied over time

以下情况产生的收入按比例在履约过程中确认:

+ Subscription: the customer <u>simultaneously</u> receives and consumes the benefits provided by the entity’s performance as the entity performs.
+ Service contract: the entity’s performance creates or enhances an asset (i.e., work in process) that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced.
+ Not basic inventory: the entity’s performance does not create an asset with an <u>alternative</u> use to the entity, and the entity has an <u>enforceable</u> right to payment for performance completed to date.

**Example 6**

![Screenshot 2021-11-27 at 01.00.15](file:///Users/yangyangchen/Documents/FRA_Typora%20Study%20Notes/assets/Screenshot%202021-11-27%20at%2001.00.15.png?lastModify=1638028127)

Revenue is recorded for the sale of the license and the installation at the time of sale. The technical support will be recognized on a monthly basis (Unearned service reveenue --> Revenue) as the support is provided.

##### 2.10.1.5.3 Methods of Measuring Progress

**Output methods** 

+ Value transferred to date, relative to the remaining 
+ Examples include: surveys of performance completed to date, appraisals of results achieved, milestones reached, time elapsed, and units produced or units delivered

**Input methods** 

- Inputs in satisfying a performance obligation
- Examples include: costs incurred 
- A disadvantage is that there may be no strict relationship between inputs and the transfer of control of considerations

##### 2.10.1.5.4 *Topic 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers*

Whenever an entity uses another party to provide goods or services to a customer, the entity need to determine whether it is acting as a principal or agent.

**Principal**: The entity controls the good or service before it is transfers to a customer. **Indicators of control** include the following:

1. The entity is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified good or service
2. The entity has inventory risk before or after the good or service has been transferred to the customer
3. The entity has discretion in establishing the price for the good or service

**Agency:** The entity arranges for the other party and the revenue recognized is equal to the fee or commission for performing the agent function.

**Gross vs Net Revenue:**

(1)  If a principal, revenue is recognized on a gross basis.

(2)  If an agent, revenue is recognized on a net basis.

### 2.10.2  Presentation

##### 2.10.2.1 Contract Asset

A *contract asset* is an entity’s right to what it has transferred. The entity transfers goods or services before a customer pays the consideration **or** before payment is due.

|      date       | 货物1交割日                                                  | 货物2交割日，款项约定支付日                   | 款项实际支付日     |

*Receivalbe is not recognized until June 1 becasue Anderson does not have an unconditional reight to the consideration until all the goods are delivered

##### 2.10.2.2 Contract Liability

A *contract liability* is an entity’s future obligation. A customer pays consideration before it transfers goods or service **or** when it has a right to an amount of consideration that is unconditional (that is, a receivable). 

| date            | 货款约定支付日                                               | 货款实际支付日     | 货物交割日                    |

| **EXPLANATION** | 确认 Receivalbe 对应有权回收的款项，确认 Contract liability 对应未交付的相关货物 |                    | 确认 Revenue 对应已交割的货物 |

> Tips: 货物交割日当天确认 revenue，可能的情况是 increase contract asset 或 decrease contract liability；货款约定支付日当天确认 Receivable，可能的情况时 decrease contract asset 或 increase contract liability。

### 2.10.3 Specific Application Within Revenue Recognition

决定一笔支出是资本化还是费用化，取决于这笔支出的性质。这项 Assets 达到可使用状态之前的一切必要的支出要资本化。

#### 2.10.3.1 Incremental Costs of Obtaining a Contract

Costs an entity incurs that would **not** have been incurred if the contract had not been obtained, and are capitalized.

![Screenshot 2021-11-28 at 02.24.55](../Documents/FRA_Typora Study Notes/assets/Screenshot 2021-11-28 at 02.24.55.png)

#### 2.10.3.2 Costs to Fulfill a Contract

Costs that meet **all** of the following criteria are capitalized:

1. Relate directly to a contract (e.g., direct labor, raw material, and costs that are explicitly chargeable to the customer under the contract)
2. They generate or enhance the resources of the entity
3. They are expected to be recovered

Costs to be **expensed** include 

1. SG&A
2. Wasted labor and materials costs
3. Costs tied to satisfied performance obligations
